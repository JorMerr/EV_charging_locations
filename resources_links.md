# ZEV registrations

    @NOTE from StatsCan *To ensure the confidentiality of the Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEV) data, a process known as Random Tabular Adjustment (RTA) was used. This changes estimates by a random amount and adds a degree of uncertainty to the accuracy of the estimate to prevent the disclosure of individual values. As a result, estimates that could disclose an individual's response are not released. (Note that if the adjusted estimates are part of a table with totals or sub-totals, the related total and sub-total estimates will also be adjusted.)*
