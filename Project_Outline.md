# Final Project

## Project Goal
    Using publicly available datasets, determine how many electric vehicle charging stations can a community support?

## Sources of Data
**[NRCAN ELECTRIC CHARGING AND ALTERNATIVE FUELLING STATIONS LOCATOR](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/)**
**[LABOUR FORCE SURVEY](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71m0001x/71m0001x2021001-eng.htm)**
**[NEW MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS- ANNUAL](https://doi.org/10.25318/2010002101-eng)**
